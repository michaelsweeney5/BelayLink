This project is meant to improve climbing safety through improving 
communication. Communicating with your partner is vital, but this tool
is no substitute for good judgement and situational awareness. This
software comes with no warranty, expressed implicitly or otherwise.

Arduino wiring diagrams are under construction. I will commit these soon.
As for the arduino libraries used, both virtualwire and software serial
are self-explanatory. Between the library documentation and the .ino file,
you should be able to figure out the wiring for the project quickly.
I used an Arduino Pro Mini, and the rest of my parts (RF Transmitter/Receiver)
and bluetooth module were purchased from Sparkfun and Adafruit.
