# BelayLink
An open source project to improve climbing communication and safety.

The description says it all. I set out to solve a problem with communication while climbing high above Colorado's rivers and wind. A pair of arduinos, a couple of breadboards and transmitter/receiver pairs later I have a working communication device with albeit limited range. This is an ongoing experiment that should improve the safety margin of climbing for most people, including allowing deaf climbers to communicate over distances.

Libraries used:
VirtualWire - handles cyclic redundancy checks in transmit and receive functions. Provides basic interfacing of arduino to rf link.
